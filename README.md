# Microcontroller based Automated Room Fan Controller

This project elaborates the design and construction of the electrical appliances of a room 
like fan to be operational on its own. That is to automate them. The temperature sensor was 
carefully chosen to gauge the room temperature. Besides, the microcontroller had been used to control the fan speed using the fan speed in rpm and the ATmega32 microcontroller was 
successfully programmed to compare temperature with standard temperature and set fan speed 
and their values displayed on LCD. Moreover, the fan speed will increase automatically if the temperature room is increased. The fan will get turned ON as soon as somebody enters the 
room. It also got turned OFF as soon as everybody leaves the room. This also saved the energy that would have been generally consumed by a fan. As conclusion, the system which was 
designed in this work was performed very well, whenever somebody entered the room and can 
be classified as automatic control. Future work can be extended to control certain devices such as A/C and other such 
home appliances etc
